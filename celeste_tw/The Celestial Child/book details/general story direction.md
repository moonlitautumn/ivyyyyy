the pre recital story will focus on Celestes life, worsening mental health, them both (separately) coming to terms that their parents themselves (not the shadows they halucinate to protect the image they have of their parents) are abusive, celeste will come to terms with this when their father dies, while Vixy will only figure this out after and will use it as a way of justifying his accidental murder to himself because "that couldnt have been my father", and the extreme pressure being imposed upon them, Vixy noticing how wrong he and his parents were treating Celeste, getting scared of his own parents (starting to see them as shadows too because "my parents wouldnt do that"), and how he eventually tried to protect Celeste from "the agressive shadow" (his father probably tried to kill/stab Celeste and he accidentally pushed him into his own knife) , leading to his sudden character development / accidental murder.

after that the story will focus on vixys/Celestes redemption and how they both will (or maybe wont) forgive themselves because one of the shadows will die at Vixys hand, and it will affect him and Celeste a LOT, post recital both of them will be severely depressed and shut-in and they will need each others support to survive, therefore the story at this point will be based on hope, "the hope of a better future", and them learning to forgive themselves from their errors; Celeste for "not trying hard enough" and Vixy for "not caring when their sibling needed him" and killing one of the shadows (he will realise they are one of his parents only after killing them).

- i want to develop Vixys friends and show them as being "close" to him just for them to disapear from the story after the incident, Ebony will be the only one that stays....
