- he has friends at school and mostly enjoys going there, his friends dont really care about him on an emotional level though.. if im being honest they (other than Ebony) are mostly just kids he spends time with and he feels this in his interactions with them, therefore he cant count on them when worst comes to worst and has to rely on his sibling.
- he initially doesnt really care that much about his sibling because he had his own friends, to him they were just someone that lived with him and that sometimes made his mother and father mad (he didnt really understand the reason, but went with it because "my parents wouldnt do anything wrong would they?")
